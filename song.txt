This goes out to all the lucky girls out there
Yeah, Friday nights with Carlina
You're a lucky girl
You're a lucky girl
You're a lucky girl
We're all lucky girls
Everyone's a lucky girl
Just got out the lion's den
What a wild ride it's been
Feeling like myself again
Rolled my sleeves
'Cause I worked through it
Get down to the beat of it
If you wanna get with it say yeah (yeah)
Say yeah (yeah)
Hands on hips and do your dance
If you wanna light the match say yeah (yeah)
Say yeah (yeah)
Free throws for days
Crowd givin' me praise
It goes like one, two, hit, glide
Keeping up my stride
Snapping like suave
Fowl how I just skate
Going up, down, and slide
A lucky girl's reprise, yeah
I'm a lucky girl (lucky girl)
I do lucky things (lucky things)
Getting all my dreams (all my dreams)
For what it's worth it seems that (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm a lucky girl (lucky girl)
And all good things come to me
Flow to me, move through me
Everything works out for me
No taking control of me
I move by my own two feet
Steady how we rock the beat
Yeah
Yeah, my life is climbing a ladder
It keeps getting better
Grab all your friends
Tell the world to
Say it with me
Gosh, I'm so lucky and
Good things are coming my way
Every minute every day (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Free throws for days
Crowd givin' me praise
It goes like one, two, hit, glide
Keeping up my stride
Snapping like suave
Fowl how I just skate
Going up, down, and slide
A lucky girl's reprise, yeah
I'm a lucky girl (lucky girl)
I do lucky things (lucky things)
Getting all my dreams (all my dreams)
For what it's worth it seems that (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm a lucky girl
And all good things come to me
Flow to me, move through me
Everything works out for me
No taking control of me
I move by my own two feet
Steady how we rock the beat
Yeah
Yeah, my life is climbing a ladder
It keeps getting better
Lucky girl's reprise
Lucky girl's reprise
Lucky girl's reprise
Lucky girl's reprise
