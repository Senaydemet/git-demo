This goes out to all the lucky girls out there
Yeah, Friday nights with Carlina
You're a lucky girl
You're a lucky girl
You're a lucky girl
We're all lucky girls
Everyone's a lucky girl
Just got out the lion's den
What a wild ride it's been
Feeling like myself again
Rolled my sleeves
'Cause I worked through it
Get down to the beat of it
If you wanna get with it say yeah (yeah)
Say yeah (yeah)
Hands on hips and do your dance
If you wanna light the match say yeah (yeah)
Say yeah (yeah)
Free throws for days
Crowd givin' me praise
It goes like one, two, hit, glide
Keeping up my stride
Snapping like suave
Fowl how I just skate
Going up, down, and slide
A lucky girl's reprise, yeah
